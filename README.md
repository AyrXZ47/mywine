my way to use wine
<br>
<br>
i use Arch btw haha.
<br>
<br>
first: 
<br>
$ sudo pacman -S wine-staging wine-gecko wine-mono lib32-gnutls lib32-sdl2 lib32-gst-plugins-base lib32-gst-plugins-good lib32-libldap lib32-libpng lib32-alsa-plugins lib32-alsa-oss lib32-freetype2 lib32-vulkan-icd-loader winetricks
<br>
<br>

optional:
<br>
$ yay playonlinux
<br>
$ winetricks corefonts
<br>
<br>
Examples:
<br>
for programs like flowgorithm:
in winetricks search MS .Net 4.7.2 and install it.

<br>
<br>

you can optate to use a cli comand like "$wine setup.exe" (recommend wine instead of wine64),  for install your archives.exe or playonlinux (if you want).

Maybe you want (actually I recommend it), not to install the windows sources from aur, better do it with wintricks and save yourself a couple of headaches.
